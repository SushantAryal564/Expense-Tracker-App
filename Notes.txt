2. Combining widget
   Text widget take as much space as its content need. so we can set size of such widget with placing those widget inside the widget whose size can be set. 
   column and row are core widget in flutter in vertical and horizontal direction. main axis is from top to button, and cross axis is from left to right in column and vice versa for row. 
3. Contianer vs Column/ Row
  Container: Take exactly one child widget, Rich alignment & styling options like border, padding, margining and many more options like decoreation, flexible width, perfect for custom styling & alignment.
  column/Row: Takes mulitple (unlimited) child widgets, Alignment but not stylish options, always takes full available height and width, Must use if widgets sit next to above each other.
  We can combine then with each other.

4. Using the string interpolation
   
5. Splitting the App into widgets
   lifting state up: It means that the common denominator 
6. Making a list scrollable
   A column take a full available height, a row a full available width. Column tries to squeeze all children it has into itself.If the child has a height which a column cannot srink child widget will not fit into the column anymore. so we need scrolling to a column. 
   SingleChildScrollView allow us to add scroll functionality but it has to be in body element.
7. Working with ListViews
   ListView is the colum with the scrollview which has a infinite height. ListView doesn't have a fixed height as it is scrollable.
   Two way of using it: ListView(childrend:[]) ListView.builder();
   Listview is like a column with SingleChildScrollView around it. All the widgets that are children are render even it they are offscreen. 
   builder we don't have wrapping single child scroll view but we have some optimization put in place by flutter. It render the widgets that are visible only. Part that aren't on the screen aren't loaded or rendered.
